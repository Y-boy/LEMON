Supplementary material for ICASSP2024 submitted paper "LEVERAGING AUDIO EMOTION FEATURE TO FIND HIGHLIGHT IN RADIO DRAMA"

1. Updated Fig.2: Qualitative results. The highlight moments selected by Lemon from Friends Season and Cabin Pressure. **Top**: Highlighted scenes of merriment at a barbecue party and the cozy exchange of gifts. **Bottom (audio wave only)**: The terminal denied the crewâ€™s request to land, and the co-pilot asked the other crewmembers, if they could get permission to land when they smelled smoke, and then teasingly lit a match.
